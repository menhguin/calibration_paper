@inbook{Lichtenstein1977,
	abstract = {From the subjectivist point of view (de Finetti, 1937) a probability is a degree of belief in a proposition whose truth has not been ascertained. A probability expresses a purely internal state; there is no ``right'' or ``correct'' probability that resides somewhere ``in reality'' against which it can be compared. However, in many circumstances, it may become possible to verify the truth o{\textsterling} falsity of the proposition to which a probability was attached. Today, we assess the probability of the proposition``it will rain tomorrow''. Tomorrow, we go outside and look at the rain gauge to see whether or not it has rained. When verification is possible, we can use it to gauge the adequacy of our probability assessments.},
