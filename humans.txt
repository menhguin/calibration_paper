LATEST TODO (for human reference only):
- Check 4 and 5 to confirm correct content Changes
- reference 3.6 public private in 5.4 CoT faithfulness

next todo:
[as of 6th may] we wanna check the structure is correct, then we do figures + hypothesis tests in whichever order

we are here, almost done -> 1. after reorg, i will also rename to slightly improve readability
2. then, after the structure/flow is settled it should be relatively more straightforward to fill everything in
3. then after that we settle the kind of hypothesis tests we use, bc we're testing quite a few that are fairly nuanced (prolly want to keep track for each finding)
4. then after that is optimal figure presentation+shuffling
5. then start passing around for comments and doing NeurIPS formatting stuff/paperwork by the 8th

let's just say it's a lot more annoying writing a really long paper and trying to reorganise than doing it at the beginning (i did put a fair bit of room for possible new findings)
