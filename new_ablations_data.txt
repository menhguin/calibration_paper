As shown in Table \ref{tab:model_calibration}, models varied widely in their overconfidence (Avg. Confidence - 
Win Rate). Some models like \texttt{qwen/qwen-max} and \texttt{qwen/qwq-32b:free} were slightly underconfident 
on average, achieving high win rates with relatively modest average confidence bets. Conversely, models like 
\texttt{deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-14b:free}, \texttt{openai/gpt-4o-mini}, and \texttt{openai/o3-mini} 
exhibited substantial overconfidence.

Analyzing confidence tiers, models betting 76-100\% confidence won only 45.2\% of the time, slightly worse 
than those betting 51-75\% (51.2\% win rate). While there were limited data points for lower confidence tiers 
(only 1 instance in 26-50\% and 0 in 0-25\%), these findings suggest that high confidence in LLMs in this 
setting is not a reliable indicator of actual success.

Furthermore, a regression analysis using debate side (Proposition/Opposition) and average confidence as 
predictors of winning confirmed that while debate side was a highly significant predictor ($p < 0.0001$), 
average confidence was not ($p = 0.1435$). This reinforces that confidence in this multi-turn, adversarial 
setting was decoupled from factors driving actual debate success.
